msgid "These images represent a basic connection diagram for the components that have typically been used to create a Driver Station. These components have typically been purchased from the *FIRST* Storefront (in the \"Control and Communication\" kit). These configurations show sample connections, and in no way represent the only possible way of connecting these components. These images also do not represent using a `Driver Station Carrier <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3386378>`_, which is recommended for teams to use for component management and transportation. See rule ``DS07`` in :doc:`Game Manual 1 <../../manuals/game_manuals/game_manuals>` for more information on Driver Station Carriers."
