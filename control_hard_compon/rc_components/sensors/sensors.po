It does this by sending out a sound wave and measuring the time it takes for the wave to travel to the object and back. Using this and the speed of sound the distance can be calculated."

msgid "An Optical Time of Flight (ToF) Sensor is a device that is able to measure the distance between an object and the sensor. It does this by sending out a light beam and measuring the time it takes for the beam to travel to the object and back. Using this time and the known speed of light the distance can be calculated. Be aware that the way the object in question interacts with light can change the accuracy of the distance measurement. A transparent object like field panels will often provide inaccurate measurements."

msgid "A Magnetic Limit Switch is used to detect the presence of a magnet in near proximity. This is commonly used to limit the range of movement of a mechanism that would cause damage if it went beyond said limit. This is done by placing a magnet on said mechanism which would cause the Limit Switch to activate. It is important to note that as a digital device this will only send out a boolean output and not a range. For measuring the strength of a magnetic field take a look at a magnetometer."

msgid "An Interial Measurement Unit (IMU) is a sensor that is a combination of a Gyroscope, Accelerometer, and Magnetometer. A Gyroscope is a device that reports the `angular orientation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry)>`_ of an object in 3 dimensions. An Accelerometer is a device that reports the acceleration of an object in 3 dimensions. Acceleration can be thought of as the rate of change of speed at any given instant. A Magnetometer is a device that measures the strength of magnetic fields in 3 axes.  This can be used as a compass to gain the orientation of a robot relative to the poles of the Earth, an absolute measurement."
