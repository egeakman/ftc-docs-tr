msgid "Game rules and in the Game Manual Part 1 have been modified to allow the use of USB Video Class (UVC) Compatible Cameras for computer vision-related tasks. Teams have the option of using an externally connected camera instead of the Android smartphone’s built-in camera for computer vision tasks."

msgid "The system supports a “UVC” or USB Video Device Class cameras. Theoretically, if a camera is UVC compliant, then it should work with the system. However, there are a couple of recommended web cameras that have been tested with the FIRST Tech Challenge software and have been calibrated to work accurately with this software:"

msgid "This port allows a user to plug a standard USB type B Micro Cable into the hub, and then connect the other end of the cable (which has a USB Type A connector) into the output port of an external 5V USB battery pack. In the image below, the Anker 4 port hub is powered by a “limefuel” external 5V battery pack using a standard Type A to Type B USB Micro cable. Note the battery is highlighted by the yellow outline in the figure below."

msgid "Note that teams can create this special cable using one end of a servo extension cable (to plug into the 5V aux port) and one end of a Micro USB cable (to plug into the Anker hub’s power port). **Creating this cable is an advanced task and should only be attempted by teams who have guidance from an adult mentor who has expertise in electronics and wiring! It is extremely important that the polarity is correct for this special cable. If the polarity is reversed it could damage your electronic equipment.**"
