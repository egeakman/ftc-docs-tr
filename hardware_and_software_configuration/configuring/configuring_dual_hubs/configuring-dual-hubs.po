msgid "A single REV Robotics Control or Expansion Hub has a limited amount of input/output (I/O) ports available. In some instances, you might want to use more devices than there are ports available. For these instances you might need to connect a second Expansion Hub to your first Hub to add more I/O ports."

Control Hubs have a reserved address, so you do not need to worry about an Expansion Hub's address when it is the only Expansion Hub connected to a Control Hub. However, the process for physically connecting and configuring them is the same."
