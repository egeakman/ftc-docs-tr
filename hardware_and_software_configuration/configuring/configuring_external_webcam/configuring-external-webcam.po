msgid "The Game Manual Part 1 allows USB Video Class (UVC) cameras for robot vision tasks. If you are using a REV Robotics Control Hub, then you will need to use an external webcam, since the Control Hub does not include a built-in camera. This document describes how to connect, configure and use an external webcam with a Control Hub."
