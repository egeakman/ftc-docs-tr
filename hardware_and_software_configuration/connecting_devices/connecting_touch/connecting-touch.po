msgid "Note that in the case of the REV Robotics Touch Sensor, the device has a connector port for a 4-pin sensor cable. However, the device only needs to connect to one of the two available digital I/O pins. For the REV Robotics Touch Sensor, the second digital I/O pin in the port is the one that gets connected when a standard REV Robotics 4-pin JST PH cable is used. For the \"0-1\" port, it is the pin labeled \"1\" that gets connected through the 4-pin cable. Similarly, for the \"2-3\" port, it is the pin labeled \"3\" that gets connected through the 4-pin cable."
