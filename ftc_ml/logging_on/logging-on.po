msgid "The *FIRST* Tech Challenge Machine Learning (ftc-ml) tool uses a Single Sign On (SSO) login through an individual’s `FIRST Dashboard account <https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/>`__ managed by the `ftc-scoring <https://ftc-scoring.firstinspires.org>`__ platform, allowing the ftc-ml tool use a *FIRST* Dashboard login session for authentication through the ftc-scoring platform. One consequence of using *FIRST* Dashboard SSO is that all users of the ftc-ml tool MUST have a *FIRST* Dashboard account. The benefits of using the *FIRST* Dashboard SSO are that team affiliation and permission levels are automatically shared with the ftc-ml tool, allowing an individual’s *FIRST* Dashboard account to be used for identity purposes and allows the team’s roster to be the definitive source for team membership information."

msgid "Before logging into the ftc-ml tool, your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) should be updated to the most recent version provided by the author of the browser. For example, older chromebooks that are limited and cannot update to the most recent version of the Chrome browser may not properly function within the ftc-ml tool. The only browser that has been fully tested with the ftc-ml tool is the Chrome browser, currently at version 94.0.4606.81 as of the writing of this document."
