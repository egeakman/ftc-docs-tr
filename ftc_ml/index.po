msgid "Please be aware, TensorFlow has multiple \"tasks\" that it can perform - among these are \"Object Detection\", \"Image Classification\", \"Speech Recognition\", \"Segmentation\", \"Natural Language Question Answering\", \"Audio Classification\", \"Optical Character Recognition\", and more. In *FIRST* Tech Challenge only the \"Object Detection\" task is supported - that allows for detecting multiple objects in an image along with bounding boxes to help identify where in the image the objects are found. Many online tools, such as Google Teachable Machines, use the \"Image Classification\" task - that allows for detecting a single object without a bounding box. These may seem similar, but they are not interchangeable. The *FIRST* Tech Challenge TensorFlow SDK **ONLY** supports the use of \"TensorFlow Object Detection (TFOD)\". ftc-ml is a tool that is supported by *FIRST* Tech Challenge - using outside tools, even those designed for TFOD, are not supported by *FIRST* Tech Challenge; because of the \"research\" classification of TensorFlow breaking changes are inevitable and maintenance of projects in the TensorFlow community is abysmal. **NO** support will be provided for outside model trainers."

msgid "This tool, the *FIRST* Tech Challenge Machine Learning toolchain **(FTC-ML)**, allows *FIRST* Tech Challenge teams to create custom TensorFlow models for use in the game challenge. Learn how to train TensorFlow to recognize your Custom Signal Sleeve images and more using this tool, and download models that you can use in your autonomous and driver-controlled Op Modes."
