Instead, they are packaged in an ``.AAR`` hosted on Maven Central. When using the Robot Controller App, these assets are included in the app. When using Android Studio, these assets are downloaded and included in your project the first time you compile the project (so an active internet connection is necessary)."

It is especially important for all users of the SDK to read the Breaking Changes section of the release notes, if one exists for a given release, and determine the impact on their existing code."

Sometimes team code can be affected if the bug required a workaround, and being elevated in the Release Notes is a way for the *Technology Team* to notify teams that the workaround is no longer necessary."
