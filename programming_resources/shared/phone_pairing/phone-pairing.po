msgid "Note that only Motorola Moto G4 Play models that have been updated to Android 7 (Nougat) are legal to use, as the minimum Android version is Android 7.0 - unfortunately Motorola no longer supports Over-The-Air updates for the Motorola Moto G4 Play, so there is no automatic way to update the smartphone. Depending on the exact model of the phone, the `Motorola Rescue and Smart Assistant Tool <https://www.motorola.co.uk/rescue-and-smart-assistant/p>`__ **may** be able to update your device, however there are no guarantees."
