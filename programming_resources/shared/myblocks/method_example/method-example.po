msgid "Your Java class may also contain methods that are not myBlocks. Consider this if you have multiple myBlocks that perform a shared internal process or calculation. This is a good programming practice in general, not specifically related to myBlocks."

msgid "To illustrate, consider the Driving Example above. Imagine you want to create myBlocks to support **two** different robots. - Robot A has **4-inch** drive wheels with AndyMark **NeveRest 40** motors. - Robot B has **3-inch** drive wheels with NeveRest **Orbital 20** motors. - You want the myBlocks to be **very simple** for your Blocks programming teammates."

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/method_example/method-example.rst:16
msgid "Your solution: - One MyBlock per robot. - Each Blocks user needs to specify only the distance to drive, in inches. - Each myBlock uses the appropriate wheel size and motor encoder CPR. - The myBlocks share a ‘utility’ method to convert distance to encoder counts."

msgid "Line 34 shows the shared method that is **not** a myBlock. Simply omit the annotation @ExportToBlocks. The keyword ``private`` means the method can be called only from inside the same class. Use this whenever possible."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/method_example/method-example.rst:28
msgid "Lines 17 and 29 call the shared method. The method calls provide 3 parameters, which do not have the same **names** as the input parameters of the ‘utility’ method – but their types should match."

msgid "At line 38, **(int)** converts, or **casts**, a decimal number to integer type. This is called **type casting**. Programmers must pay close attention to compatible data types. For example, a DC motor ``set .TargetPosition`` Block should be given an encoder value as a simple integer, not a decimal number."

msgid "At line 15 and others, the keyword ``final`` indicates a Java **constant**: a variable that cannot change value. Java constants are traditionally ALL CAPS. Can you find the Math constant in this program?"
