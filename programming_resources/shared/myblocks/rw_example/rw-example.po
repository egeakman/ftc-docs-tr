msgid "The current version of regular Blocks (SDK 7.0) does not provide **read/write access to an external file**, other than automatic Log or Match Log file entries. File access is a useful capability, available so far to Java programmers only. Now it can be done with myBlocks!"

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/rw_example/rw-example.rst:9
msgid "Here’s an example pair of myBlocks. One myBlock **writes** a numeric value to a specified filename, and a companion myBlock can later **read** that value from the same file."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/rw_example/rw-example.rst:15
msgid "The file is stored on the Control Hub or RC phone, in the FIRST/settings folder. It exists separately from the RC app, OpModes, and other files."

msgid "Write and read actions can happen in the same OpMode or **different OpModes**, allowing various scenarios:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Autonomous passes information to TeleOp. For example, what was the latest value of a sensor or encoder?"
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/rw_example/rw-example.rst:25
msgid "A special **set-up OpMode** allows gamepad input to choose an autonomous strategy and adjust key parameters. The robot could then be idle for a long time, even turned off. When the match begins, the Autonomous OpMode would read those settings and implement the chosen/adjusted actions."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/rw_example/rw-example.rst:31
msgid "A **dedicated log file** reports key sensor data in a custom format, with optional time-stamps. For program development and debugging, this could be more efficient than working with the large standard logs or Match Logs."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/rw_example/rw-example.rst:36
msgid "The Java code for this example is available below, with **extensive comments** that explain some unfamiliar Java expressions. The code can be copied and pasted directly into OnBot Java or Android Studio."

msgid "Programming tip: Instead of memorizing every possible Java command, programmers often study and modify existing code for a similar task. Unfamiliar commands are explored with an internet search, reference book, at the `Javadoc reference <https://javadoc.io/doc/org.firstinspires.ftc>`__, or at the official `Oracle Javadoc <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/>`__."

msgid "This simple example supports only a single numeric value per filename. Better versions would allow multiple values and data types – a good programming challenge!"
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/rw_example/rw-example.rst:53
msgid "Be careful about placing **myBlocks inside loops**. Expanding on the current example, your myBlock might read a larger amount of (unchanging) data from a file. If your OpMode needs that data only once, reading the file in a loop needlessly adds cycle time and might increase the risk of a corrupt or interrupted read operation."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/rw_example/rw-example.rst:61
msgid "Instead, read the file once and store the relevant data in a variable or array. Then process the variable as needed, inside the loop."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/rw_example/rw-example.rst:66
msgid "The same suggestion might apply to reading sensors and encoders, if the data are not changing and are needed only once."
