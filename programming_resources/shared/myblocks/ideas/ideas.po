msgid "Set one or more program variables during INIT, **using the gamepad**. This can be done with regular Blocks, but a good User Interface (UI) requires multiple long and complex Functions."

msgid "Create driving actions with **multiple sensor controls**. For example, gyro-based steering towards a distance goal (ultrasonic or vision target). Or Run_To_Position while following a line. A myBlock can provide Blocks users with controls previously considered too complex."

msgid "One of the above examples controls a servo specified by the Blocks user. This could lead to a **family of separate myBlocks** to interact with 1 device, 2 devices, etc. Or a generic single myBlock could interact with, say, up to 4 DC motors. The Java method would process only those DC motors with a filled-in parameter name."

msgid "Limit the number of parameters. If your myBlock needs certain information that won’t change during the OpMode, use an **initialize method** that’s called once at the start of the OpMode. The initialize method stores that information, to avoid repeatedly passing the same parameter each time the myBlock is called."
