msgid "The required **annotation** ``@ExportToBlocks`` has optional fields, which may be listed in any order. These fields allow a myBlock to have a custom **comment**, **tooltip**, and **parameter labels**."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:12
msgid "Comment"
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:14
msgid "The **comment** text appears in a balloon when the Blocks user clicks the blue question-mark icon. Tell the user **how to use your myBlock**."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:17
msgid "Must be entered on a **single line**, with no ‘line breaks’. This requirement can be met by **joining text strings**; an example is :ref:`here <programming_resources/shared/myblocks/hardware_example/hardware-example:hardware example: control a servo>`."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:20
msgid "The blue icon will appear only if a custom comment is specified. The Blocks user can add and remove the blue icon, and can edit its text in the (re-sizeable) balloon."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:25
msgid "Tooltip"
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:27
msgid "A **tooltip** appears with a **mouseover**: hovering the mouse cursor over an image or icon. Every Block has a short tooltip to **indicate its purpose**."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:30
msgid "Must be entered on a **single line**, with no line breaks."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:31
msgid "If a custom tooltip is not specified, the default tooltip will name the method, its enclosing class, and return type."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:33
msgid "Another tooltip, for the grey input socket (at right), is auto-generated based on parameter type."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:37
msgid "Parameter Labels"
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:39
msgid "The **parameterLabels** text appears on the myBlock, each next to its grey input **socket**."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:41
msgid "Multiple labels are separated by a comma. Line breaks may be used between labels."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:43
msgid "For a single parameter, this also works: ``parameterLabels = \"sampleParameter\"``."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:46
msgid "In the Hello World example, you may have noticed that the parameter label **Recipient** was not the same as the Java input parameter name **greetingRecipient**. They don’t need to be the same. One is for the Blocks user, the other is for the Java programmer. Just list them in the correct/same order, so their meanings correspond."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:52
msgid "In fact you don’t need to label every input; a default label will instead show the declared type (e.g. String, boolean, int, double, etc.). In any case each grey socket will contain a sample of the required type (e.g. A, false, 0), with an appropriate tooltip."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:57
msgid "If the number of parameter labels does not match the actual number of Java parameters, **all** custom label will be ignored. Instead the default labels will be displayed."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:61
msgid "A myBlock may have up to 21 parameters… not recommended! Keep things simple."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:64
msgid "Again, the annotation ``@ExportToBlocks`` **must** appear immediately before each myBlock method, even if not using the optional fields."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:67
msgid "Two more optional annotation labels, not illustrated here, are:"
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:69
msgid "``heading``, such as “My Amazing myBlock”. The default heading is “call Java method”."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/myblocks/annotation/annotation.rst:71
msgid "``color``, without quotes, just a color number (hue). For example 155 is green, 255 is blue. Default is 289. Check it out!"
