msgid "Here is the Java code (method only) for converting an **inches of driving** target into an **encoder counts** target. The conversion depends on the drive motors’ counts-per-rotation (CPR), and the diameter of the drive wheels. This example assumes 1:1 gear ratio between the motor and wheel."

msgid "This method takes three inputs from the Blocks user, and **returns** one output (of type ``int`` or integer) to the regular Block that **calls** the myBlock."

msgid "Notice the ``(int)`` operator at the ``return`` command. This converts or **casts** the countsToDrive variable of type ``double`` to type ``int``, to be compatible with the required **return type**. Learn more about **type casting** `here <https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_type_casting.asp>`__ or `here <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/type-conversion-java-examples/>`__."

msgid "As programmer, you could modify this example in many ways, such as: - handle a **gear ratio** between the drive motors and wheels - the second and third parameters could be **‘hard-coded’** into the myBlock, if they will never change - those 2 variables could be initialized in a **non-myBlock method** and used by multiple myBlock methods in that same Java class"
