msgid "The Kotlin programming language is a a modern alternative to the Java programing language that compiles and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can be used to develop Android applications. It was developed by JetBrains, the same company that developed the IntelliJ IDE (the basis for Android Studio)."

msgid "Full interoperability with Java; you can use Java classes and libraries from Kotlin and vice versa."
msgstr ""

#: programming_resources/shared/installing_kotlin/Installing-Kotlin.rst:21
msgid "Dynamic typing; Kotlin allows you to use dynamic typing when needed, that is, you don't need to specify the type of a variable when it can be inferred from the context (``var myString = \"Hi!\"``)."

msgid "Null safety; Kotlin has a type system that helps eliminate null pointer exceptions."

Teams that use Kotlin do so at their own risk and should expect that there will not be technical help/support available at events in the case of software issues."
