msgid "Cameras are composed of many different components that can introduce variability in the actual image that a camera ultimately \"sees\". Camera calibration is a process that mathematically models how a camera & lens combination ultimately sees the world, for example how wide the field of view is. Calibrating your camera is a must if you desire to use it for high-precision tasks, such as performing precision measurements using the camera or obtaining accurate 6DOF pose data from fiducial marker systems like AprilTags. It's important to note that calibrations are not only specific to the camera and lens, but also specific to the resolution used on a particular camera as well!"

msgid "Due to the differences in refractive index, calibrations performed in air and in liquids (for example, in water) are not transferrable. Calibrations must be performed within the medium that the camera will be operating in."

msgid "For advanced teams, using `MRCAL <http://mrcal.secretsauce.net/>`__ is likely the best option - it is a tool developed by NASA JPL that provides extensive data on how good your calibration is and what goes into the numerical optimization to arrive at the optimal parameters."
