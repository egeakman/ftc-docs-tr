msgid "Exposure is the amount of light that reaches the webcam sensor. It is an important part of how bright or dark your image appears."

msgid "Exposure varies directly with the amount of time that the shutter is open, allowing light to enter and reach the sensor. So, the interface ExposureControl uses a single value of **duration**, in units of time that you specify, typically ``TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS``."

msgid "For example, at a frame rate of 60 frames per second (fps), exposure duration is 1/60 of a second, or 1/60 x 1000 = 16 milliseconds. This basic tutorial does not address frame rate."
