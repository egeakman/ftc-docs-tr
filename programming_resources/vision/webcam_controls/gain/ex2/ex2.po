msgid "Higher gain does improve recognition, then performance declines. Then at higher levels, this TFOD model begins to “see” a Cube, not a Duck. The gain effect was similar to the exposure effect."

msgid "These two charts suggest that TFOD results are affected by, and can perhaps be optimized by, setting specific values for exposure and gain. A team should compare this with the default or automatic performance of their robot and webcam, in the full range of expected match conditions."
