msgid "The SDK provides methods for virtual pan (horizontal motion), tilt (vertical motion), and zoom (enlargement and reduction of image size). This is **virtual** PTZ since the actions are digitally simulated, within the full original image captured by the webcam. Pan and tilt are possible only to the extent that zoom has provided extra image space to move in that direction."
