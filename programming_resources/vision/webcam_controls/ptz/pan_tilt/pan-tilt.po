msgid "A webcam does not typically express pan and tilt values in *pixels*, the smallest unit of image capture by the webcam sensor. For example, the Logitech C920 and the Microsoft LifeCam VX-5000 have a range of +/-36,000 units, far greater than the pixel count in each axis."

msgid "The webcam accepts pan and tilt as a pair of (x, y) values. Thus the SDK pan and tilt methods handle these values **only as a pair**, in a special class named PanTiltHolder. This class has two fields, named pan and tilt, of type integer."
