msgid "AprilTags - :doc:`AprilTags <../../../apriltag/vision_portal/apriltag_intro/apriltag-intro>` are fiducial markers similar in design to a QR code that can be used for identification and localization. AprilTags are used as reference points for autonomous navigation and for assisted navigation and identification of points of interest on a game field."
