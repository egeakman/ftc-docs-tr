msgid "A sensor is a device that lets the Robot Controller get information about its environment. In this example, you will use a REV Robotics Color-Distance sensor to display range (distance from an object) info to the driver station."

msgid "The Color-Range sensor uses reflected light to determine the distance from the sensor to the target object. It can be used to measure close distances (up 5\" or more) with reasonable accuracy. Note that at the time this document was most recently edited, the REV Color-Range sensor saturates around 2\" (5cm). This means that for distances less than or equal to 2\", the sensor returns a measured distance equal to 2\" or so."
