msgid "During a typical *FIRST* Tech Challenge match, a team's robot must perform a variety of tasks to score points. For example, a team might want their robot to follow a white line on the competition floor and then score a game element into a goal autonomously during a match. Teams write programs called *op modes* (which stands for \"operational modes\") to specify the behavior for their robot. These op modes run on the Robot Controller after being selected on the Driver Station."

A user can create custom op modes for their robot using this tool and then save these op modes directly onto the Robot Controller.

The Blocks Programming Tool is powered by Google's Blockly software and was developed with support from Google."
