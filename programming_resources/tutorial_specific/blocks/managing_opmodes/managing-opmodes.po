msgid "Blocks is a programming language that uses graphical programming elements to create programs. As such its file format is different than, say, a JAVA or other text-based programming language file. Blocks programs are saved with a **.blk** extension, but its contents are actually formatted as XML (Extensible Markup Language).  The actual XML format in a Blocks program is beyond the scope of this document, except to say that it's not intended to be read/viewed/interpreted by any other program than Blocks. There is not a general program on a MAC or a PC that can view or edit the Blocks program, it must always be done through the Blocks interface within the Robot Controller App (running on a REV Control Hub or legal Android SmartPhone) - that is, to say, you cannot simply double-click on the file to open it up in an editor program that lives on your computer."

It is recommended to check out this document for learning how to work with Blocks OpModes."

msgid "It's important to understand what is meant by **\"Saving\"** an OpMode. When programming/editing an OpMode, you're using either a web browser (Chrome, etc.) or you are using a program *acting* as a web browser (REV Hardware Client, etc.).  The program that you are creating/editing only *ephemerally* exists within the web browser; there is no auto-save or feature to ensure that the program is ultimately saved back onto the device (REV Control Hub or approved SmartPhone) for use by a robot. Only the *SAVE* operation will actually save the OpMode to a **.blk** file onto the device. Therefore, it's imperative that Blocks programmers *SAVE* their work often, and especially once they have completed their work. The mechanism by which you can *SAVE* an OpMode is via the \"**Save Op Mode**\" button within the editing window of the software."

msgid "Once an OpMode has been saved to a device, the OpMode can be selected via the Driver Station or edited again via the programming interfaces. However, that Blocks program only exists as a Blocks File (**.blk**) on the device. Often it is desirable to save a copy of the program on your laptop (or on another device, or in some other safe location) or provide the program for use by others (teammates, another robot, other teams, provide online, etc.)."

msgid "While editing an OpMode, an OpMode can be *saved* and it can also be *downloaded* (there are other options, but we're just going to focus on these two for the time being). When an OpMode is saved, the program is saved **onto the device** into a Blocks file (**.blk**). In order to save a copy of the program to your local computer (for safe storage or for sharing) you need to *download* the program. Downloading the program *does* issue a Save action on the current program, but this should not be relied upon - programmers should always save their program before downloading. Downloading an OpMode is performed via the \"**Download Op Mode**\" button within the Editing Interface."
