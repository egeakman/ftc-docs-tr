msgid "As a benefit of being a *FIRST* Tech Challenge Team, some sponsors of *FIRST* programs have generously provided complimentary software, licenses, and/or support to teams.  These licenses are generally good for a period of one year and many must be renewed annually. Sometimes sponsored content require the use of a donation voucher provided in your FIRST Dashboard team account, sometimes sponsors merely require your Team number and contact information, and some software is simply provided free of charge with no proof of registration requirement. Read details below for each product for more information."
