msgid "Tip for both of the Prusa printers listed on this page. You can now order Prusa printers from either their headquarters in Czechia or their subsidiary and sole authorized reseller **PrintedSolid**, based in Delaware. If you live in the USA and plan to order a Prusa printer, save yourself the headache of customs and long shipping times and order from their USA subsidiary."

msgid "If you're looking to buy a printer that just works every time, the Prusa MK3S+ is amazing. Prusa has had millions of hours running these machines, and just about every issue with this printer has been found, patched, and pushed to the consumer. If it's any testament to their consistency, the 3d printed parts used on the Mk3s+ are printed mostly on Mk3s+ printers. This is Prusa's previous flagship printer and is more tested and cheaper than the Mk4, but if you are looking at Prusa make sure to explore the Mk4 as well due to it's more updated features."
