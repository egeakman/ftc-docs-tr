msgid "If you're noticing any issues with over/under extrusion or if you just got a new printer, it's highly advisable that you tune your e-steps. E-Steps dictate how many steps the extruder motor takes to extrude a certain amount of filament. This procedure is best covered in videos, so go take a look at `Thomas Sanladerer's video on the topic. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUPfBJz3I6Y>`_"
