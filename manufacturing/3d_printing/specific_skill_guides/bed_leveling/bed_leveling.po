msgid "This guide is primarily for older printers that don't have automatic leveling. If you have a newer printer, this process is likely not needed or there is a more advanced process to follow. Research what processes are available for your printer."

msgid "If you have a bed thats adjustable by screws, bed leveling is by far the biggest factor for how well your prints stick across the whole bed. The only tool you should need is a 0.2mm thick piece of metal, a piece of cardstock, or an index card."

msgstr ""

#: manufacturing/3d_printing/specific_skill_guides/bed_leveling/bed_leveling.rst:36
msgid "Once your printer is leveled between the screws, the bed is flat, but it's not always at exactly the right height. All printers should have a Z offset variable that lets you adjust the height of the nozzle during or before printing. If at the start of your print the bed is either located too high or too low, but remaining consistent (provided you bed leveled), use your printers Z offset feature (also called baby-stepping) to adjust it live while it lays down the first layer. Reference the images below for some good visualizations on how to make sure you're at the proper height!"
