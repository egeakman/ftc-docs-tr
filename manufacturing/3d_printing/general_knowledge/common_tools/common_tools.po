msgstr ""

#: manufacturing/3d_printing/general_knowledge/common_tools/common_tools.rst:7
msgid "Allen keys are essential for operating your printer, even if you don't plan on upgrading, regular maintenance and repairs will require these. It's suggested that you buy high quality allen keys that won't strip your screws from the start (this goes for other tools as well!). The most common sizes for allen keys on today's printers are **2.0mm and 2.5mm** but we'd recommend stocking other sizes as well."

msgid "Screwdrivers are another tool to keep handy for repairing your printer especially for operating in spots hard to reach with allen keys and for screws other than hex key. It's suggested to get a kit with many small bits such as the one pictured below for easy maintenance, unless you already know exactly what type and size screws are utilized on all your 3d printers."

msgid "Flush cutters, otherwise known as diagonal cutters, snips, or snippers by teams, are an extremely versatile tool that can be used for cutting and trimming things on your printer or your prints. A cheap pair like pictured below is still great for 3D Printing and general use, just make sure that they stay sharp!"

#: manufacturing/3d_printing/general_knowledge/common_tools/common_tools.rst:52
msgid "Many people think that they can just cut PTFE tube with scissors or flush cutters, but fail to realize the downsides of this. The compression of scissors or flush cutters can compress the sides of the tube or deform it, and when some PTFE tubes have little room for error, this can make a tube unusable. Specialized PTFE tube cutters like the one pictured below can make sure that one of the most important parts of filament transport on your printer is good quality. The one pictured below is clamped onto a PTFE tube, spun around it a few times, and then the cut will be complete with little effort."

msgid "Calipers are a precision measuring tool used to measure distances often down the the hundredth of a millimeter. These are incredible useful for dialing in pressfits and slipfits, ensuring dimensional accuracy, and tuning your printer. We'd recommend getting a quality pair with solid reviews that will last you a while and remain precise."
