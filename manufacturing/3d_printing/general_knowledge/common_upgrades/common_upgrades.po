msgstr ""

msgid "A lot of printers come with cheap \"BuildTak\" (typical stickers) beds that work just fine, but some people desire more removeable prints with better adhesion and more customizability, which is fulfilled by removable beds. WhamBam, Bambulabs, and generic Amazon sellers will typically carry these beds for various prices. You'll see some terms which we'll explain here. PEI is the \"gold standard\" nowadays, simply being a sheet of material that sticks well to 3D prints when heated. More advanced options includev PEX, which expands when heated and holds onto 3D prints better, and then as it cools completely releases the parts. Powder-Coated PEI/Textured PEI are by far the most popular flexible beds now, being cheap, simple, more resistant to damage than PEI or PEX flexible beds, and having exceptional print adhesion."

msgid "Glass beds are also a great upgrade, they stay flat and last a long time. They also tend to be a lot cheaper than flex beds! A glass bed combined with something like glue stick or hairspray works really well to keep prints secure. Most glass beds found on Amazon will work, look for the keywords Carborundum or Borosilicate when looking for glass beds for your printer size."

msgid "A hotend upgrade can be very beneficial for printing with different filaments, speeding up prints, and general reliability. Learning how to mount hotends often takes some CAD skills or a quick Thingiverse search, but hotend upgrades are very worth it. Typically, you will need a hotend structure, heater wire, and thermistor to do a full upgrade (and some wiring tools to connect it to your board). Here are a few hotends from different price ranges that are well regarded and used."

msgid "Older printers or low end printers tend to be very loud stock, which is why silent stepper boards are a great upgrade. These boards use more advanced stepper drivers to smooth inputs, causing steppers to make less whining and whirring noises. For most printers you will have to do some research for the best replacement board for you, but for base model Ender 3 printers, the main compatible boards are the SKR Mini E3 and the SKR Mini Turbo, both of which are drop-in replacements and take no time at all. Luckily, most printers nowadays include this option stock, so it's not a concern for many."

msgid "Network functionality is becoming frequent in 3D printing, with many interfaces allowing you to interact with your printer remotely, and stop/start/watch prints while you aren't even there. Many companies have begun including this feature stock with newer printers, however, even if you have a printer without network functionality, using something such as a Raspberry Pi or old android phone, you can make quick work of this feature using various online guides. If you're using a printer with **Marlin** firmware (you can read through your printer's documentation or sale postings to check) you should research **Octoprint** setup guides. If you are using a printer with the **Klipper** firmware, you should research **Fluidd** and **Mainsail** setup guides."

msgid "A common issue people have with Ender 3's and other budget printers is the droop of the Z gantry if it's only driven by a lead screw on one side. This directly results in inconsistencies in prints due to a less stable frame. A fairly common solution to this is to add a lead screw on the other side, evening it out. This requires a board upgrade and an extra stepper. There are plenty of kits for this, or you could attempt to DIY it yourself."

msgid "As talked about in Terminology, hotend and part cooling are vital to part quality and preventing jamming issues. If you want to print PLA at higher speeds, it's recommended to upgrade your cooling fans to be larger and more efficient. 5015 and 4020 fans are a great upgrade from stock cooling, and can handle most of what's thrown at them. There are plenty of mounts available for these fans if you search up your printer model and the desired fan size (fan sizes are given in width-depth, so a 5015 comes in a 50mm circle that is 15mm thick) If you want a cooling upgrade with a lot of science behind it, take a look at Voron Design's **AB-BN** or **Stealthburner** projects, cooling systems that were completely engineered with air flow simulation."

msgid "A lot of 3D Printers use V-wheels for linear motion out of the box, however these can degrade, flex, and lose dimensional accuracy fairly easily. Steel linear rails helps make your carriage a lot more stable and unlocks the ability to print much faster. While this upgrade can be very valuable, it's important to keep in mind that this is one of the most expensive upgrades here, as good quality linear rails can cost upwards of 40$ apiece."
