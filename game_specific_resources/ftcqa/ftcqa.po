msgid "The `Game Q&A <https://ftc-qa.firstinspires.org/>`_ is a forum/tool that provides teams an opportunity to receive clarifications from the Game Design Committee about the current season's challenge. Rulings on the Q&A are final and binding, so all teams must make sure to check back and review the Q&A often. Game rulings made within the Q&A system are NOT guaranteed to be reflected in the appropriate Game Manual."

msgid "Once the `Game Q&A <https://ftc-qa.firstinspires.org/>`_ opens for the season (usually within 2-3 weeks of the challenge being announced) teams may ask questions using unique accounts provided to teams via their `FIRST Dashboard <https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/>`_ accounts. Teams must use these credentials to log into the system, and then may ask questions. Anyone may create a personal account and view or tag questions, but only accounts provided to teams may ask questions."

The Q&A website credentials for the team will be listed under the \"Game Q&A Forum Accounts\" section of the resulting webpage."

This one-page summary is not guaranteed to contain all questions and answers, and is also not guaranteed to be updated on a regular basis, but it is the best way to obtain a printable format of the questions and answers on the forum."
