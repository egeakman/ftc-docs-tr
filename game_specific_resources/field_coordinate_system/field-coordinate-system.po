msgid "This document defines the “standard” Coordinate System (orthogonal axes) definition for a *FIRST* Tech Challenge playing field. This definition can be used for consistent field-centric navigation, target localization and path planning."

#: game_specific_resources/field_coordinate_system/field-coordinate-system.rst:15
msgid "The reference frame for this definition is the field perimeter wall, adjacent to the RED Alliance Station (known here as the: RED WALL).  The definition is from the perspective of a person, standing outside the field, in the center of RED WALL, looking towards the center of the field."

msgid "Caveat: If the Red Alliance Station is ever adjacent to two perimeter walls, the RED WALL will be the one with *most* contact with the Alliance Station. If the red Alliance Station is ever adjacent to two perimeter walls EQUALLY, then the most clockwise of the two walls will be considered to be the RED WALL."

msgid "The 0,0,0 origin of the *FIRST* Tech Challenge coordinate system is the point in the center of the field, equidistant from all 4 perimeter walls (where the four center tiles meet). The origin point rests on the top surface of the floor mat."

msgid "When considering rotations about an axis, consider yourself looking down the (positive) axis of rotation from the positive towards the origin. Positive rotations are then CCW, and negative rotations CW."

msgid "An example: consider looking down the positive Z axis towards the origin. This would be like standing in the middle of the field, looking down. A positive rotation about Z (i.e. a rotation parallel to the X-Y plane) is then CCW, as one would normally expect from the usual classic 2D geometry."
